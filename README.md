**Variables**

a = 1
b = 1.2
val = True
test = "Yes"
print ( str(a) + " " + str(b) + " " + str(val) + " " + test)

**String Manipulation**

a = "Python programming"

print(len(a)) #length of string 
print(a[1]) #character at position 1
print(a[-1]) #1st character from last
print(a[1:3]) #character from position 1 to 3
print(a[1:]) #character from position 1 end
print(a[:3]) #character from position 0 to 3
print(a[:]) #copy of string
